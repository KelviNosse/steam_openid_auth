# Steam OpenID Authentication
**This is a tiny script for making sign on using steam credentials.**

If you want to use it, make sure you generate an [apikey](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) from Steam.

And replace ``` SECRET_KEY ``` with your key on the corresponding ``` app.config.update() ``` function.
